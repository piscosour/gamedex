GameDex
=======

GameDex is a custom solution to document and catalog video game records, for later parsing and analysis. It captures information on a game, such a release date, developers, etc., for archival purposes. It is designed to keep track of the game production across a specific community (say, geographic, historical, or thematic), especially in cases where games have not been properly documented and references are hard to find.

GameDex works under the assumption of a fairly limited dataset that can be parsed through for patterns - it is not intended as an encyclopedic compendium of all games in existence.

Above all, GameDex is a learning project - I'm using it to familiarise myself with both the dataset I'm using in a research project, and to think about ways in which this dataset can be analysed computationally. It is also a project I'm using to become better acquainted with working on Python. This orients design decisions in ways which might seem counter-intuitive or suboptimal.
